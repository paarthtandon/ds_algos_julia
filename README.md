# Algorithms for Data Science in Julia

This repo will contain the implementation of algorithms taught in CS 514 at UMass Amherst. All algorithms will be written in Julia. This repo is not meant to be used outside of a learning context. I am a beginner to Julia, and will most likely make many mistakes.
